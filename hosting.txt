I highly recommend using a service called Netlify. It's extremely user-friendly, reliable, and the process is fast.
Here is a step-by-step guide to get your site live.
The 3-Step Plan
Put your code on GitHub: A free service for storing and managing code.
Create a free Netlify account: The service that will host your site.
Connect Netlify to your GitHub project: This tells Netlify where to find your code and publish it.
Step 1: Upload Your Project to GitHub
If you're not familiar with git commands, the easiest way is to use the GitHub website directly.
Sign up: Create a free account at github.com.
Create a New Repository:
On your GitHub dashboard, click the "+" icon in the top right and select "New repository".
Give it a name (e.g., my-nonprofit-site).
Choose "Public".
You can skip all the other options (like adding a README).
Click "Create repository".
Upload Your Files:
On your new repository page, you'll see a section that says "...or upload an existing file." Click on the "upload an existing file" link.
Drag and drop all of your project files and folders (index.html, App.tsx, components/, etc.) into the browser window.
Wait for them to upload, then scroll to the bottom and click "Commit changes".
Your code is now stored on GitHub!
Step 2: Deploy Your Site with Netlify
Now we'll tell Netlify to take that code from GitHub and put it online.
Sign up: Go to netlify.com and click "Sign up". The easiest way is to "Sign up with GitHub". This will automatically and securely link your accounts.
Import Your Project:
Once you're logged into your Netlify dashboard, click "Add new site" and choose "Import an existing project".
Click on the "GitHub" button.
Netlify will show you a list of your GitHub repositories. Find the one you just created (my-nonprofit-site) and select it.
Configure Your Site's Settings:
This is the most important part, but for your specific project, it's very simple. Netlify will ask you for "build settings." Because your project doesn't need a complex build step, you'll use these settings:
Build command: Leave this field completely blank.
Publish directory: Leave this field blank as well. Netlify is smart enough to find your index.html in the main directory.
That's it for the settings!
Deploy:
Click the "Deploy site" button.
Netlify will now take a minute to deploy your website. You'll see a "Deploy in progress" message. When it's done, it will say "Published".
Step 3: Visit Your Live Site!
Congratulations! Your site is now live on the internet.
Netlify will give you a free, random URL like https://some-random-name.netlify.app. You can find this link at the top of your site's dashboard in Netlify.
You can easily change this random name to something more memorable for free. In your site's settings on Netlify, go to "Domain management" -> "Options" -> "Edit site name".
From now on, whenever you push any changes to your code on GitHub, Netlify will automatically see them and redeploy your website with the updates
